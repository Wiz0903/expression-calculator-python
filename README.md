Project Name: Python Expression Calculator

Description:
This project is a command-line calculator built with Python that allows users to enter full arithmetic expressions such as 2 + 4, 10 * 3, or 2 ** 3 and instantly receive accurate results. The program intelligently detects operators, splits user input, converts values to the correct numeric types, and safely handles errors such as division by zero.

This project demonstrates strong fundamentals in string manipulation, user input handling, conditional logic, and basic error checking.

Key Features:

Supports +, -, *, /, and exponent (**) operations

Handles integers and decimal numbers

Prevents division by zero errors

Clean and user-friendly output

Purpose of this Project:
This project was built to practice Python fundamentals and strengthen problem-solving skills through real-world logic implementation.
